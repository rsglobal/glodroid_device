Subject: [PATCH] Bluetooth: Add new quirk for broken local ext features
 max_page

Some adapters (e.g. RTL8723CS) advertise that they have more than
2 pages for local ext features, but they don't support any features
declared in these pages. RTL8723CS reports max_page = 2 and declares
support for sync train and secure connection, but it responds with
either garbage or with error in status on corresponding commands.
